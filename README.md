Tasks from the artificial intelligence course

Task 1.
Task was to find a solution to the 8-puzzle. The puzzle is composed of 8 numbered boxes and one empty space. The boxes can be moved up, down, left or right, but only if there is a gap in that direction. There is always a starting position and a goal position, and a sequence of steps must be found that lead from one position to the other.

Task 2.
Travelling Salesman Problem
A business traveller has to visit several cities. It is in his interest to minimize travel costs, and the cost of transport is proportional to the length of the journey, so he tries to find the shortest possible route so that he visits each city just once. Since he eventually has to return to the city from which he started, his journey is a closed curve.
Solutions: genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.
